- For table open requests larger than the tablespace default backing collection size (now 128), the table opener thread might try to open the table more than once.
  Reproduce by executing test/YakServer/testTableOpenStorm.py (which tests the first 100 tables), with Tablespace default size set to 16 (other values might work)
  Possible fix: Instead of using a std::vector<>, use an array-like backend. It must NOT reallocate ANY of the ptr chunks (default chunk size of 128 seems reasonable)
        (because of synchronization issues otherwise) but it must use a linked-chunked-list like approach --> singly-linked list of 128-sized chunks
